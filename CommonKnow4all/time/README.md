The knowledge base is automatically created from multiple other resources, e.g., WordNet-Aﬀect and OMCS.

ConceptNet is a semantic network created by the Open Mind Common Sense (OMCS). It is a directed graph whose nodes are concepts, and the edges represent assertions of commonsense about the concepts, e.g., “is a”, “is used for”, “motivated by goal”, etc. The nodes are natural language phrases, e.g., noun phrases, verb phrases, or clauses. The latest version of the knowledge base is ConceptNet 5.5, which contains over 8 million nodes and over 21 million links.
